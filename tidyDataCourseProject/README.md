## run_analysis.R script description

  The script was made as a course project for "Getting and Cleaning Data" on-line course.
  It's expected to be run in the same directory as the unpacked data, expected folders/files layout is the following:

  ```
  /folder_with_script/run_analysis.R           -- the script
  /folder_with_script/features.txt             -- all feature labels
  /folder_with_script/activity_labels.txt      -- activity labels

  /folder_with_script/train/X_train.txt        -- training data set features
  /folder_with_script/train/y_train.txt        -- training data set activity labels
  /folder_with_script/train/subject_train.txt  -- training data set subject ids

  /folder_with_script/test/X_test.txt          -- test data set features
  /folder_with_script/test/y_test.txt          -- test data set activity labels
  /folder_with_script/test/subject_test.txt    -- test data set subject ids
  ```
  
  Script writes file with tidy data into tidyData.txt.
